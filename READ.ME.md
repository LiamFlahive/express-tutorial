<H1>Welcome</H1>
To run this, start by installing Node.js 4.3.1 (https://nodejs.org/en/)

Once installed open up a shell and cd to this directory

Do the following:

 1. Check node is installed by typing: 

  node -v 

  (you should see 4.3.1)

 2. Next type:

  npm install

  (Stuff may or may not happen spew out)

 3. Once that is finished type:

  npm start

  Output should be
  
   ">tutorial@0.0.0 start C:\Users\name\Desktop\tutorial"
   
   ">node ./bin/www"

 4. open a browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000/

  You should see a very basic web page

  Open app.js, routes.js and public/index.html and try and learn whats going on. 
  Read my comments for help.
  
 **from now on you only need to type "npm start" to run the page**
 
 **press ctrl-c (cmd-c on a mac) in the shell to end the current run**

See http://expressjs.com/ for documentation about express.
